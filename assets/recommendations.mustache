<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">After months of research, Food Empowerment Project has published our list of chocolate companies that sell vegan chocolate. We placed this list on our website for a variety of reasons:</span></div>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"></span>

<br />
<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" type="1">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">To help people buy chocolate that does not involve the enslavement of human (children or adults) or non-human animals (such as cows and goats).</span></li>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><br /></span>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">To make sure consumers are informed about where companies stand on the issue.</span></li>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><br /></span>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">To encourage consumers to contact the companies and let them know how they feel!</span></li>
</ol>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><i>Understanding our list</i>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">The list is made up of several categories:</span>
<br />
<div class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><b>Chocolate we feel comfortable recommending</b>. The first category is pretty simple. These are companies that make some (if not all) vegan chocolates. They have responded to us when we requested where they get their cacao beans were not
sourced from areas in West Africa where child slavery
is the most pervasive.<br /><br /><b><span style="line-height: 115%;">Cannot recommend but are working on the issues in various ways</span></b><span style="line-height: 115%;">. These are companies that responded to our request for information and are either fair trade, organic and/or have indicated to us that they are aware of the slavery issue and care enough to work on it, but, unfortunately, their chocolate still comes from the Ivory Coast or non-cooperatives in Ghana. They are currently buying chocolate with the intention of not participating in slavery, but we can't be 100% sure that it is not linked to slavery as they source from these countries in West Africa.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: small;">
</span><br />
<div class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Some of the companies that are fair trade are not necessarily going to change suppliers, but they are indeed informed companies trying to do their part.<br /><br />If they are
fair trade, then why aren&#8217;t they listed on our recommended list? It is
unfortunate, but there has been child labor found at fair trade
cooperatives.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">The fact that child labor was found here gives us reason to be
concerned; therefore, we do not feel comfortable recommending them at this
time. We acknowledge this might change, but for now, this is how they rank on
our list.<br /><br /><b>Cannot recommend but at least responded.
</b>We list the companies that responded honestly but don&#8217;t make our list.<b><br /><br />Cannot recommend: companies that would not disclose their supplier (no transparency for customers)</b>. Not disclosing where their chocolate is sourced from is really no different than those companies that did not respond at all. For any of these companies to not disclose to consumers which suppliers they use reminds me of corporations that plead ignorance to the fact that their suppliers are exploiting adults and/or children. Not to confuse anyone, but we do not ask for supplier contacts; we simply ask from which country they get their cacao beans. Wanting to hide the information seems, well, like a sign of guilt.<br /><br /><b>Cannot recommend: companies that did not respond</b>. As simple as that. They did not respond to our request. These companies give us the impression that they feel they are above needing to answer and perhaps have a guilty conscience.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">How do we contact the companies? Food Empowerment Project is an all-volunteer organization, and we have had a number of superb activists who have emailed the companies requesting where they get their cacao beans from. If the response is &#8220;Switzerland,&#8221; &#8220;USA&#8221; or some other non-cacao-producing country known for its chocolate, another email is sent reminding them we are talking about the beans, not the chocolate. If there is no response, another email is sent after two weeks &#8211; forwarding the original request. After another week passes, the two reminders are sent again, this time with a link to our list, letting them know they will go on our non-response list if we do not hear back. After a week with no response, we put them on our website. <br /><br />Our list is updated as companies respond to us.<br /><br />We encourage people from all over the globe to send us the names of companies that make vegan chocolate products that are not already on our list; we will look into the company to see where they should be placed on our list.</span></div>
