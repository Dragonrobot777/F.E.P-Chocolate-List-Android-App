    <string name="app_name">Chocolate List</string>
    <string name="app_description">The list reflects Food Empowerment Project\'s most recent research on companies that make vegan products containing chocolate to find out if they source their chocolate from areas where slavery can still be found.

Companies such as Nestl√©, Mars, and others are culpable, but are not listed as they do not make vegan products. 

This list is not comprehensive. We continue to reach out to more companies and will be updating the list as we receive responses. Again, all of the companies make vegan chocolates but they may also sell non-vegan chocolates - we have tried to help, but we encourage you to read the ingredients to be sure.
